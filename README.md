## 🖼️ The Widget & Layer Engine

**Your timer is a canvas.** Don't just track time; build a scene.

* **Scalable Text:** Add text layers that grow with your vision. Double-click to edit, drag the **blue handle** to resize the font, and use the **green handle** to rotate.

* **Local Images:** Upload your own PNGs/JPGs to act as decorations, references, or branding.

* **Magnetic Snapping:** Enable **Snap to Grid** to utilize magenta guides for pixel-perfect centering.

* **Layer Control:** Use the **Layers Panel** to stack, reorder, or **Lock 🔒** elements so they don't move while you're clicking the timer.

## 🎵 Visual Lyric Synchronization

Transform your countdown message into a music video.

1. **Trim:** Upload an audio file and use the dual-range sliders to crop the perfect clip.

2. **Sync:** Paste standard `[mm:ss.xx]` LRC timestamps.

3. **Animate:** Watch as the `h1` title glitch-animates in perfect sync with the beat.

## ⚙️ Modular & Detachable UI

Stop digging through menus. The interface is yours to break apart.

* **Detachable Windows:** Every settings section (Audio, Modes, Data) can be dragged out into its own **Floating Window**.

* **Minimize to Taskbar:** Click `_` on a detached window to tuck it away into the bottom toolbar for quick restoration.

* **Quick Access Toolbar:** Check your favorite modes in settings to create permanent, one-click toggle icons on your main dashboard.

## 💾 Zero-Loss Persistence

Since Tenshon Timer lives in your browser, don't let a refresh kill your vibe.

* **Export Config:** Save your colors, custom fonts, loaded lyrics, and widget layouts into a single `.json` file.

* **Import Config:** Drag and drop your `.json` back into the app to instantly restore your entire custom environment.
